# Greenbriar Technology Group — Website

The static marketing site for **Greenbriar Technology Group**, live at
[www.greenbriartechnology.com](https://www.greenbriartechnology.com).

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) (plain static HTML/CSS, minimal JS) and
deployed automatically to **GitHub Pages** on every push to `main`. Design: a
fixed-width "teletype" aesthetic — mint green primary, burnt orange secondary,
IBM Plex Mono.

Hosting, the custom domain, HTTPS, and the apex→www redirect are already
configured. This README covers day-to-day maintenance.

## Local development

Requires **Node.js 22.12+**.

```sh
npm install      # install dependencies (also enables the git hooks)
npm run dev      # dev server at http://localhost:4321
npm run build    # build to ./dist
npm run preview  # preview the production build
npm run lint     # astro check (well-formed pages + types) + eslint
npm test         # Playwright tests (first run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium)
npm run check:links  # fetch every external link, report OK/WARN/FAIL (ad hoc)
```

## Editing content

- **Site-wide info** (name, tagline, email, location, nav links): `src/consts.ts`.
- **Page copy**: edit the matching file in `src/pages/`. Most pages keep their
  content in a small data array at the top of the file.
- **Team members**: the `members` array in `src/pages/about.astro` — name, bio,
  LinkedIn, and photo. Bios are currently empty; add real text there. For
  photos, drop a square image (≥600×600) in `public/team/` and point the `photo`
  field at it (e.g. `/team/jane-doe.jpeg`). Don't hotlink LinkedIn images —
  those URLs are signed and expire.
- **Colors / fonts / spacing**: the CSS custom properties at the top of
  `src/styles/global.css` (`--mint`, `--orange`, `--paper`, `--mono`, ...).

## Adding a page

1. Create `src/pages/<name>.astro` (copy an existing page for the layout).
2. Add it to the `NAV` array in `src/consts.ts` so it shows in the nav and footer.

The test suite automatically checks the new page is reachable, well-formed,
link-clean, and accessible.

## Quality checks

`npm run lint` and `npm test` run in CI on every pull request
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and gate merges into `main`:

- **`tests/links.spec.ts`** — crawls every page: 200 status, well-formed
  `<head>`, no broken links or images, no uncaught JS errors, valid in-page
  anchors, and nav reachability.
- **`tests/site.spec.ts`** — behavior: the 404 page and the mobile nav toggle.
- **`tests/a11y.spec.ts`** — an [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core)
  WCAG 2.1 A/AA scan on every page.

A `pre-commit` hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`, enabled by `npm install`) blocks
direct commits to the protected `main` branch — work on a feature branch and
open a PR. External links aren't checked in CI (some hosts block bots), so run
`npm run check:links` by hand when you change them.

## Deploying

Automatic: every push to `main` builds and publishes via
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The custom domain (`public/CNAME`), HTTPS, and
apex→www redirect are already set up — there's nothing to do.

## Project structure

```text
